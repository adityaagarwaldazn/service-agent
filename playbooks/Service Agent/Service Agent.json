  "goal": "The goal is to methodically leverage the available tools in a specific sequence to answer the user's query. Begin by using the 'list_tables' tool to retrieve the list of tables within the dataset. Next, use the 'get_table' tool to obtain the schema of a specific table. Based on the schema retrieved, construct a relevant SQL query. Finally, use the 'sql_query' tool to execute the query on the data and generate the answer. Ensure that you rely solely on the available tools and do not fabricate any information.",
